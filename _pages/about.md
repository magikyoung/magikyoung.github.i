I'm a PhD student from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu) at[North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu). I'm currently working under the supervision of [Dr.Xipeng Shen](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/xshen5/) in [PICTure Research Group](https://research.csc.ncsu.edu/picture/) 

My research mainly focus on optimizing machine learning algorithms to achieve higher speed and scalability. My studies have covered some widely used machine learning algorihtms, e.g. _citation KNN_, _Gaussian mixture model_ and _density peak clustering_.

Before coming to North Carolina State university, I received my Master and Bachelor from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).
